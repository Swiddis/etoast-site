# Intentionality: a Ten-Second Exercise

{{ author_date }}

*Conciseness.*

My first improv teacher was fond of making us set intentions every class. He'd
leave a short pause, no more than ten seconds. It wasn't enough time to plan
ahead; you pretty much went with the first thing that came to mind. Something
you want to experiment with, improve, or really any other kind of goal. It had
to be short because if it were too complex, it would be impossible to remember
mid-scene.

I've noticed that good things happen when I set intentions for myself in other
contexts, too. It reduces my wandering in conversations. It makes workdays a
little more productive. Detours are less frequent and tend to be shorter-lived
when teaching others. Coding sessions feel more instructional as well.

After class, he would ask us to think of a word or phrase to reflect on the
lesson. Again, the pause would be around ten seconds. It had to be short because
class was over and people had places to be.

*Direct.*
