# About Me

Hi, I'm ExaltedToast, and I'm a distributed systems engineer.
My hobby is thinking about things, such as:

* Algorithms
* Baduk
* Languages
* Literature
* Mathematics
* Pedagogy
* Philosophy
* Software

Sometimes, I put those thoughts down in text.

## Why this site?

In _The Pragmatic Programmer_, David Thomas and Andy Hunt argue that "Don't Repeat Yourself" isn't about code.
It's about life.
As a mentor, I've noticed that I repeat myself quite often on various subjects.
I wanted a place to deposit some of the ideas that come up a bunch, so I could just link it and call it good.
This site is an evolving repository where I share whatever I feel like.

My operating rule of thumb is that if I feel like saying it thrice, it's important enough to make public.

Also, I just happened to have a spare server lying around. May as well make a website with it.

### How did you make it?

The pages are markdown documents, thrown in a [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template that uses [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/). The web server is written in Rust, using the [Rocket Framework](https://rocket.rs/). Deployment is done through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with some additional routing by [Nginx](http://nginx.org/).

## Resources

There are a few resources that have been greatly influential to me. Hopefully some of them can help you out too. I also put quite a bit of information in my writing, see the `Learning` section.

* [No More Zero Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz) is what got me started on being more than someone who plays games all day.
* [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) are the sole resources that got me started on pursuing STEM as a career.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is the site that taught me most of what I know about algorithms.
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/) is a book that I feel helped me transition from programmer to software engineer.
* [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) has solidifed a solid amount of my current opinions on clean code and unit testing.
* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) is another career-defining book for me.
* [Jordan has no life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbvDQKzAJ5GwCjTrv4FWkxg) is a fantastic Youtube channel if you want a primer on the stuff I do for a living.
* [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
* [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
