        <a href="/">Home</a>
		<p>
            Hi, I'm Simeon Widdis (they/them), also known as ExaltedToast, and I'm a distributed systems engineer at AWS.
            My hobby is thinking about things, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Baduk</li>
            <li>Literature</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>Pedagogy</li>
            <li>Philosophy</li>
            <li>Software</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sometimes, I put those thoughts down in text.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to chat in text, either
            <a href="mailto:sawiddis@gmail.com">email me</a>
            or join <code>##hackslash</code> on

        <h2>resources</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few resources that have been greatly influential to me.
            Hopefully some of them can help you out too.

                is what got me started on being more than someone who plays games all day.

        <h2>socials</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, here's some more socials.
            The rest of my personal social media is private.
            This is intentional.
            Don't go looking.
