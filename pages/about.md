# {{ title }}

Hi, I'm Simeon Widdis, a garden-variety software engineer with a penchant for
algorithms. My hobby is thinking about things, such as:

* Code
* [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))
* Languages
* Literature
* Mathematics
* Pedagogy
* Software

Sometimes, I put those thoughts down in text.

## Why this site?

I spend a lot of time doing stuff. In addition to my work as a developer, there's
hobbies like language learning and reading, and far too many little scripts that I write
and forget about. I wanted to have a repository to start writing about the things I do.
Things I'm learning about or making, what's on my mind, a little slice of the internet
where I could just talk about whatever I find cool.

That said, there aren't any guarantees on the upload schedule, since I generally only
want to post here if I think I have something new to say. Most of a developer's time is
spent reading, after all.

Also, I just happened to have a spare server lying around. May as well make a website
with it. A lot of my friends are doing it!

### How did you make it?

Static sites are generated with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Historically
I served it on a VPS, but I've since moved to
[NearlyFreeSpeech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/). You can read the source
code on the [Git Repo](https://github.com/Swiddis/etoast-site).

## Resources

There are a few resources that have been greatly influential to me. Hopefully some of
them can help you out too. I also put quite a bit of information in my writing, see the
`Learning` section.

* [No More Zero Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz) is what got me started on being more than someone who plays games all day.
* [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) are the sole resources that got me started on pursuing STEM as a career.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is the site that taught me most of what I know about problem solving.
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/) is a book that I feel helped me transition from programmer to software engineer.
* [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) has solidifed a solid amount of my current opinions on unit testing.
* [Jordan has no life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbvDQKzAJ5GwCjTrv4FWkxg) is a fantastic Youtube channel if you want a primer on the stuff I do for a living.
* [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

## Socials

I'm not really a fan of social media. I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/Swiddis)
where I work on stuff, but aside from that there isn't much else.
