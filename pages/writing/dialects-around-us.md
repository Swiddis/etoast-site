Humor me, if you will, and think of something you've written lately. Maybe a
form you've filled out or a particularly clever post on social media. Perhaps an
essay you procrastinated on or a memo for some coworkers. Next, try describing
what you wrote in a short phrase, no more than five words. Exercise as much or
as little creativity as you want. Now, think of the context around that
document: what led to you writing it, and what was the result afterward?
Finally, come up with two other contexts where you might use the same phrase,
based on that before and after. The more metaphorical, the better.

For me, the phrase is "a five-part story." When I started writing it, I felt
frantic, an incoherent jumble of emotions and scenes playing in my head. I sat
down and tried to tell the story of how I got to feeling that way, arbitrarily
deciding it would be five parts long. I ended up diffusing myself after writing
four of them. Describing the events in that way, the two alternative scenarios
come to mind for me quickly. A five-part story could refer to when one has a
complex problem that they're not sure how to even start explaining: "How did the
date go?" "Oh, it's a five-part story." A five-part story could also refer to a
process that's more complex than it needs to be, as in how I really diagnosed
the problem in four parts. "Man, this application process is such a five-part
story."

If you played along, you just constructed a new idiom.

*Dialect,* a small tabletop game by Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalıoğlu, is all
about this. In it, you and a few other players build your own little library
from these pieces of language. A few hours later, you tear it down. I remember
finding it remarkable how quickly we were able to do this; after just a few
turns, we had already started saying sentences that would make no sense if you
weren't in the group. If you spontaneously try using your idiom from the last
section with others, you'll likely be met with a confused response as well.

Fonda Lee's *Jade City* is a book that does this extremely well. Over the course
of the book, you'll find yourself getting increasingly familiar with the city's
own idioms and vocabulary. Near the end, I had the same type of feeling as I had
while playing *Dialect.* That I only could understand these sentences because
I'd been primed on the local language. When the book switches to the perspective
of outsiders to the country, you palpably feel the difference in how they speak.
Some of the most impactful scenes in the book for me were built on these
expressions that had been introduced only a chapter or two before.

It's easy to see this process in constructed environments like games and fantasy
books. However, experiencing these environments also made me more aware of the
dialects around us. Any linguist can tell you this process of idiomatization
happens regularly, but it's easy to miss just how frequent and natural it really
is.

It's an often-commented phenomenon that when one joins a new company, they need
to become familiar with a bundle of technical terms and acronyms. A similar
thing happens when joining a new group of hobbyists or friends; there's always
some set of stories, media, or resources that one needs to become familiar with.
As you spend time with others, you automatically build these shorthands for past
experiences and inside jokes. This happens on your own too when learning a new
topic and later trying to share it with others. It's a built-in part of how
language works.

Even mathematics has this issue, despite often being characterized by a
"Definition, Theorem, Proof" mindset, which emphasizes carefully defining all
relevant terms. William P. Thurston discusses this extensively in his essay *On
Proof and Progress in Mathematics,* where he challenges this characterization
and emphasizes the role of clear communication. Look at how he describes the
same problem.

Thurston calls these subfield-specific patterns "mental infrastructure," an
idiom that I've found valuable to incorporate into my own vocabulary. Accounting
for mental infrastructure turns out to be important when introducing ideas to
others, and having a term for the phenomenon has helped me to identify cases
where context or a definition may be necessary. It's why I'm a big fan of
putting glossaries in my documents, and why it feels like a lot of my writing
can boil down to "Here's what this term means." Knowing that this is a normal
part of context switching means I'm less afraid to ask questions about
terminology and less impatient when others ask the same of me. It's appropriate
that Thurston recognizes value in those who are fluent in multiple subfields,
able to bridge these communication gaps.

When writing for an audience, it can be instructive to ask how much of that
audience is likely to understand some specific term. I can speak to the
experience of trying to follow along with someone else's presentation without
understanding some core terminology. I also know the experience of being the one
giving that presentation. There's an art in finding good ways to communicate
mental infrastructure. One of the first steps to improving at it is to recognize
it exists and notice its appearance in the dialects around us.
